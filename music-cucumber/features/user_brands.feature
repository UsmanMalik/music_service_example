Feature: User brands
  As an API client
  In order to do things with user brands
  I want to test CRUD for user brands
  
  Background:
    Given I send and accept JSON
    And a user exists
  
  Scenario: List user brands when there are no brands for the user
    # When I send a GET request for "/user/abcd/brands"
    # Then the response status should be "200"
    # And the JSON response should have 1 "$.."
  
  Scenario: Create a user brand
  
  Scenario: Update a user brand
  
  Scenario: Delete a user brand
